## Description
"Chess for Desktop" is a great program to learn chess and try new tactics for all level of players: Beginners, Intermediate, and Advanced.

As this game is initially designed for two players, playing with a partner is highly recommended. The player who goes first becomes "White" and the player who moves next becomes "Black". In every single turn, each player is given 60 seconds, and if the player does not move within the given time, the opponent automatically gets the turn.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ
**Q. Main page and chess pieces are not shown properly. How can I solve this issue?**

There are `res` and `src` on root(top) directory.
The `res` contains all images used by the program. You can use `getResource` function to retrieve the image and assign to `Swing` Object. For example, the following code will assign `res/logo.jpg` to the image icon of `this`.

```
this.setIconImage(new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("/logo.jpg")).getImage());
```

To make sure `resource` is working properly, you should set up the project structure like the following instruction. First, click `res` directory. Second, set as `Resources`. Thatâ€™s it! All images of pieces in the `res/pieces` directory have already been prepared.

**Q. How can I save my game? And how can I load an existing game?**
* To save (This feature only works while you are playing the game)
  1. Go to the right side of the screen and click `Save Game`
  1. Choose the directory and the name of file
  1. Click `Save`
  1. Go to the upper left side of the screen and click `Game` > `Exit`
  1. Click `Yes` and go to the directory to check whether the file has been successfully saved

* To load
  1. Run the game
  1. Click `Load Game` on main page
